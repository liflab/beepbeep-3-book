Foreword
========

You may not believe me, but I started to write this book because I was *lazy*.

What started as a small documentation file ended up as a complete book, which in its current version contains:

- 50 different code examples, for a total of 5,225 lines of Java
- 10 illustrations
- 20 exercices across all chapters
