Foreword
========

You may not believe me, but I started to write this book because I was *lazy*.

What started as a small documentation file ended up as a complete book, which in its current version contains:

- @codeexamples different code examples, for a total of @codelines lines of Java
- @figures illustrations
- @exercises exercices across all chapters
