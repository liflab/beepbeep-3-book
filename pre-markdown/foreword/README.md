Foreword
========

You may not believe me, but I started to write this book because I was *lazy*.

What started as a small documentation file ended up as a complete book, which in its current version contains:

- **85** different code examples, for a total of 2,600 lines of Java
- **86** colour illustrations
- **24** exercices across all chapters
